Write a NodeJS-based solution in JavaScript, using Express framework and ES6 language features.
The solution, upon request to its REST interface, should:
- asynchronously read data from a table in database into array of objects with fields id, code, name
- filter acquired data with all of the following rules: id field is not null, empty or undefined, AND code strictly equal to string "025", AND name contains text "test"
Then solution should take the filtered array of objects and send it asynchronously to a SOAP web service (compose a request, underlying HTTP call can be mocked)
After that solution should respond with data received from web-service. 
Solution interface should conform to REST standard.


DB: table codeNames

create table codenames(id INTEGER, code VARCHAR, name VARCHAR)

insert --->

 id |  code   |         name          
----+---------+-----------------------
    | 03325   | test
  3 | 025     | test //// '025 ' instead of '025'
 31 | 222025  | tsssrsfest
  1 | 025     | Some text and not a test
  5 | 025     | some name
  7 | 025     | testing filter
(6 rows)
